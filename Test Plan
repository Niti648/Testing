3. Introduction
 
The purpose of this test plan is to outline the testing approach for Google's Search Engine. 
This document provides an overview of the testing process and its various components.
 
4. Objectives
The primary objectives of testing the Google Search Engine are:
 
Ensure the accuracy and relevancy of search results.
Validate the performance, scalability, and reliability of the search infrastructure.
Verify the functionality across multiple platforms and devices.
Detect and report defects and issues.
 
5. Scope
 
The testing scope includes:
 
Functional testing of search features (e.g.,text search, voice search, image search).
Performance testing (load testing, stress testing, and response time).
Compatibility testing across different browsers and platforms.
Security testing to identify vulnerabilities.
Usability testing for user interface and user experience.
Localization and internationalization testing.
 
6. Test Strategy
 
Our test strategy includes the use of automated testing tools for regression testing and manual testing for exploratory and usability testing. 
The test data will be a combination of synthetic and real-world queries.
 
7. Test Environment
 
The test environment comprises various configurations:-
 
Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Mobile devices (iOS and Android).
Desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
 
8. Test Cases
 
Detailed test cases will be developed to cover all aspects of search functionality, performance, and security. Test cases will be categorized based on different aspects of the search engine.
 
9. Test Execution
 
Testing will be conducted in phases, including:
 
Functional testing.
Performance testing.
Security testing.
Compatibility testing.
Usability testing.

10.Entry & Exit Criteria

Entry -
		○ Project requirements have been finalized and shared by BAs with testing team.
		○ Test environments have been set up with scrambled data and testers have the required access
		○ Unit test has been performed and evidence is provided to the test team to commence shakeout
		○ Any outstanding defects will be communicated to the test team prior to the commencement of test execution activities.
		○ Test coverage, test priority and test cases built have been agreed and signed off by the appropriate parties
		○ Required test data has been sourced or created.

Exit - 

	• All identified tests have been executed, and their actual results have been recorded
	• There are no open severity 1 or 2 defects
	• Workarounds and business impacts are defined, understood and agreed on with the business for severity 3 & 4 defects
	• The Test Summary has been reviewed and approved by the Project Manager or stakeholders
Open defects (if any) have been documented with the appropriate resolution plan in place and signed-off by the Business to go-live with these defects.


 
11. Defect Reporting and Tracking
 
Defects will be documented using a standardized format and tracked using a defect tracking system. Severity and priority will be assigned to each defect for efficient resolution.
 
12. Test Deliverables
 
The following deliverables will be produced:
 
 Test plan document (this document).
 Test cases and test data.
 Test execution reports.
 Defect reports.
 Final test summary report.


13. Environmental Needs
 Special Power Requirements.
 Specific versions of other supporting software.
 Restricted use of  the system during testing.
    

14. Staffing and Training Needs
   Training on the application/system.
   Tarining for any test toold to be used.
  

15. Responsibilities
    Table for Roles and Responsibilities assigned to each team.

16. Schedule
    Melestones for various project activities.

17. Risks and Assumptions

Assumption: Access to the Google search infrastructure and necessary resources.
Risk: Data privacy and security concerns.
Risk: Potential impact on users during testing.
 
18. Conclusion

This test plan outlines our approach to testing Google's Search Engine comprehensively. It ensures that the search engine functions accurately, performs well, and remains secure and user-friendly.
 
Please note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, a test plan for Google's search engine would be much more detailed and tailored to the specific needs and complexities of their system. Additionally, it would require collaboration with Google's engineering and testing teams, access to their internal systems, and compliance with their security and privacy policies.
